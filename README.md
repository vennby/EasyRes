<h3> TLDR; What is <b>EasyCV</b>?</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Automation tool for quickly building tailor-made resumes for applying to different domains or roles</li>
  <li>Maintains complete database of profile and dynamically generates resume based on user's selections</li>
  <li>Has a user authentication system, keeps records of all resumes made in the past and allows for browsing</li>
</ul>

<h3> Why'd I build it? </h3>
<p align="justify"> 
  I was applying to a whole lot of internships and entry-level jobs, and I had no idea what kind of work I wanted to do. I knew to list my strengths and weakness pretty well in interviews, but I simply wasn't able to even <em>make</em> it to an interview because my resume wasn't going through. I even understood why that was the case; I'd send the same resume to everyone and I tried to make it as generalized as possible, hoping that the recruiter for the UI/UX role I applied to doesn't realise that I sent the same CV to a data science position. And of course, it made sense that I wasn't getting any calls for an interview.
  
  But as much as I was sick of this, and as much as I realized what the problem was, I also had another problem that I still haven't been able to overcome; laziness. Like, I'll work <em>extremely</em> hard on something that I'm interested in, and I'll do it <em>only</em> if I'm interested in it. And, constantly changing my CV for every job that looked attractive to me was absolutely not it. I desperately wished there was a site that would do this for me, for free, of course. Spoiler alert: there wasn't.
  
  So I just built it myself. Yup, instead of just making some 3 different resumes meant for different roles, I just <em>had</em> to build an application that did it for me.

<h3> How to run it? </h3>
<p> Clone the repo, download it, do whatever you'd like to set it up in your code editor. Then, simply run </p>
<p align="center"> <code> pip install -r requirements.txt </code> </p>
<p> to first install the necessary libraries all at once. Since this is a Flask application, </p>
<p align="center"> <code> flask run </code> </p>
<p> should do the job. EasyCV would be up and running on your local machine in nearly no time! </p>
