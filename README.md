  I was applying to a whole lot of internships and entry-level jobs, and I had no idea what kind of work I wanted to do. I knew to list my strengths and weakness pretty well in interviews, but I simply wasn't able to make it to an interview because my resume wasn't going through. I even understood why it wasn't; I'd send the same resume to everyone and I tried to make it as generalized as possible, hoping that the recruiter for the UI/UX role I applied to doesn't realise that I sent the same CV to a data science position. And of course, it made sense that I wasn't getting any calls for an interview.
  
  But as much as I was sick of this, and as much as I realized what the problem was, I also have another problem that I still haven't been able to overcome; laziness. Like, I'll work <em>extremely</em> hard on something that I'm interested in, and I'll do it <em>only</em> if I'm interested in it. And constantly changing my CV for every job that looked attractive to me was absolutely not it. I desperately wished there was a site that would do this for me, for free, of course. Spoiler alert: there wasn't.
  
  So I just built it myself.
